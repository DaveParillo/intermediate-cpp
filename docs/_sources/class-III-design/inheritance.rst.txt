   pair: virtual; keyword

Inheritance
===========
Inheritance enables new classes to receive --- or inherit --- 
the properties and methods of existing classes. 
In C++, we can extend a class,
adding data members or behavior in a new type.
Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: cpp

   class enum Color {RED, ORANGE, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE, INDIGO, VIOLET};

   class shape {
       Color color_ = Color::BLUE;
     public:
       virtual ~shape() = default;
       void   color (Color new_color) { color_ = new_color; }
       Color  color ()  const         { return color_; }
       virtual void   move();
   };

The class ``shape`` defines common behaviors that
can be shared among all classes.
This shape class provides some definitions and requires
derived classes to provide others.

In the base class ``shape``,
the ``virtual`` keyword instructs the compiler that the marked functions
can be *overridden* in derived classes.
The shape example illustrates different ways base class functions
may be implemented.

The ``color`` functions are not marked virtual.
These functions are inherited by all derived classes,
and cannot be overridden.
These functions represent a *mandatory implementation*.
In this design, **every** shape must have a color,
and it is changed using these functions.

The ``move`` function is marked virtual.
A default implementation is defined in the ``shape`` class,
but derived classes are free to override it if needed.

The shape class destructor: ``~shape()`` is also marked virtual.
Even if this class manages no resources, 
it is a good idea to define a virtual destructor for every base class.
This allows derived constructors to be called if the base class is used
in a container.

Derived classes declare their bases immediately after the
derived class name.
The general format is:

.. code-block:: cpp

   class derived_name: {access_modifier} base_name, {access_modifier} base2_name, . . . 

Applying this to our base class shape we can define a circle like this:

.. code-block:: cpp

   class circle: public shape {
      double radius = 1;
     public:
       void   move() override;
   };

Which creates a by default a blue circle with radius = 1.
A circle inherits its ability to change color from its parent: shape.
This circle implements its own version of the ``move()`` function.

The keyword ``override`` tells the compiler that this function
intends to *override* a virtual function in a base class.
Although a C++11 feature and not required,
it is a best practice since it provides the compiler
more information about your intent and can flag functions
with incorrect signatures.

Note that a class may inherit from more than one base class.

Base class references and pointers
----------------------------------
One of the primary benefits of inheritance become apparent when passed
as parameters or when used in container classes.
Object references and pointers will call the correct derived class member
function in an inheritance hierarchy.
For example, some part of our drawing program need to draw **any** shape,
without having special case code to determine *what* the shape type is:

.. code-block:: cpp

   draw_shape (const shape& s) {
     s.draw();
   }

   int main() {
     Circle c;
     draw_shape(c);
   }

Although we can't instantiate a ``shape``,
we *can* pass a derived class instance (circle, triangle, etc.)
to a function that takes a *reference to a shape*.
This works because a ``circle`` **is a** ``shape``.
A ``circle`` is both a ``circle`` **and** a ``shape``.

Passing a pointer would work as well as a reference:

.. code-block:: cpp

   draw_shape (const shape* s) {
     s->draw();
   }

   int main() {
     Circle c;
     draw_shape(&c);
   }

The polymorphism achieved by assigning derived classes **only**
works when assignment is through a reference or a pointer.

Recall that containers are limited to values of a single type
and that references are not :term:`assignable`.
How do we create a vector of ``shape`` objects?
Through a pointer:

.. code-block:: cpp

   #include <memory>
   #include <vector>

   using std::unique_ptr;
   using std::make_unique;

   draw_all (const std::vector<unique_ptr<shape>>& shapes) {
     for (const auto& s: shapes) {
       s->draw();
     }
   }

   int main() {
     std::vector<unique_ptr<shape>> shapes;
     shapes.push_back(make_unique<circle>());
     shapes.push_back(make_unique<rectangle>());
     shapes.push_back(make_unique<triangle>());

     draw_all(shapes);
   }

The :cref:`std::vector`` of unique pointers could have been
implemented with a vector of raw pointers:

.. code-block:: cpp


   std::vector<shape*> shapes;
   shapes.push_back(new circle());

This version works essentially the same as the previous version,
but requires a bit more code to manage our own memory.

When to use inheritance
-----------------------
Adapted from *Composition vs. Inheritance: How to Choose?*.

The most common --- and beneficial --- use of inheritance is to
incrementally extend types.
If we need a widget that is just like an existing Widget class,
but with a few tweaks and enhancements,
then inheritance is suitable.
Inheritance is the right choice because our derived class is still a widget.
We want to reuse the entire interface and implementation from the base class
and our changes are primarily **additive**.
That is, the derived class adds capabilities to base.
If you find that a derived class is removing things provided by the base class,
then question inheriting from that base.

Inheritance is most useful for grouping related sets of concepts,
identifying families of classes,
and in general organizing the names and concepts that describe the domain.
As we delve deeper into the implementation of a system,
we may find that our original generalizations about the domain concepts,
captured in our inheritance hierarchies,
are incorrect.
Donâ€™t be afraid to disassemble inheritance hierarchies into sets of
complementary cooperating interfaces and components
when the code leads you in that direction.

There is no substitute for object modeling and critical design thinking.
But if you must have some guidelines, consider these.

Inheritance should only be used when:

- Both classes are in the same logical domain
- The derived class is a proper subtype of the base class: think **is a**
- The base class implementation is necessary or appropriate for the derived class
- The enhancements made by the derived class are primarily additive

.. index::
   pair: private; inheritance

Private inheritance
-------------------
In the classes derived from ``shape``, 
we declare ``public`` members of the shape class
to also have ``public`` access the derived classes.
Compare:

.. code-block:: cpp

   class circle: public shape {} // case #1: public inheritance

   class circle: shape {}        // case #2: private inheritance


In the second case, the public members of shape
are treated as ``private`` members of class circle.
This is almost always a bug for new programmers
and a common source of error.

The default inheritance model in C++ is *private inheritance*
for classes and public for structs.
In private inheritance **all** of the base class members:
data and functions, public, protected, and private,
are treated as **private members** of the derived class.

A common question is "Why would we ever do this?"

If a derived class wants to reuse all of the code from a base class,
but *not* conform to the interface,
then private inheritance is how to achieve that.

Consider :cref:`std::stack`.
It is a container that *adapts* the capabilities of an underlying container.
Although the default container for a :cref:`std::stack` 
is a :cref:`std::deque`, 
we don't want to expose all of the functions of a ``deque`` in a ``stack``.


.. index:: non-virtual functions; manatory interfaces;
   single: shadowing

Non-virtual base class functions
--------------------------------
Every non-virtual base class function defines a
**mandatory interface** for all derived classes.
The language allows a derived class to implement its own version.
For example:

.. code-block:: cpp

   struct B {
     void foo();
   };
   struct D: B { 
     void foo();        // derived class D has its own version
   };

If class ``D`` implements its own version of ``foo``,
then this is **not** an ``override``.
This is called *shadowing* and is often a bug.

The problem is this:

- An instance of ``B`` will always call ``B::foo()``
- An instance of ``D`` will always call ``D::foo()``
- An instance of ``D`` in a container of pointers to ``B``
  will call ``B::foo()``.

  New programmers are often caught off guard by this behavior.

  Most modern compilers will warn about this.

Even if the programmer is careful to ensure the contract defined
by ``B::foo()`` is also met by struct D,
there is no guarantee this can't change in the future.
There is no way to know what else may depend on the contract 
defined by ``B::foo`` or any if its invariants.

In general, if a derived class can't use the existing mandatory
interface defined by a base class,
then it probably shouldn't be a derived class.

.. index:: diamond of death
   pair: multiple; inheritance
   pair: Bjarne Stroustrup; multiple inheritance

Multiple inheritance
--------------------
C++ allows for a single class to inherit capabilities from more than 1 class.
The constructors of inherited classes are called in the same order
in which they are inherited.
For example, in the following program,
Bâ€™s constructor is called before Aâ€™s constructor.

.. activecode:: ac_mult_inherit_ex1
   :language: cpp
   :compileargs: ['-Wall', '-Wextra', '-pedantic', '-std=c++11']

   #include<iostream> 
   using std::cout; 

   struct A { 
     A() { cout << "construct A\n"; } 
   }; 

   struct B { 
     B() { cout << "construct B\n"; } 
   }; 

   struct C: public B, public A {     // Note the order 
     C() { cout << "construct C\n"; } 
   }; 

   int main() { 
     C c; 
   } 

The destructors are called in reverse order of constructors.   

**The Diamond of Death**

Since C++ allows multiple inheritance,
the following relationships are valid:

.. graphviz:: 
   :alt: multiple inheritance

   digraph "person"
   {
     edge [fontname="BitstreamVeraSans",
           fontsize="10",
           labelfontname="BitstreamVeraSans",
           labelfontsize="10",
           dir="back",
           arrowtail="onormal",
           style="solid",
           color="midnightblue"];
     node [fontname="BitstreamVeraSans",
           fontsize="10",
           height=0.2,
           width=0.4,
           color="black",
           fillcolor="white",
           shape=box,
           style="filled"];
     Person -> Student;
     Person -> Teacher;
     Student -> ta;
     Teacher -> ta;
     ta [label="TeachingAssistant"];
   }

The ``TeachingAssistant`` class is both a ``Teacher`` and a ``Student``
and inherits two copies of the ``Person`` base class data.
When a TA is created, the Person constructor is called *twice*.
Once for each copy of the Person stored.
This is both wasteful and creates ambiguities.

The C++ solution to this problem is to inherit *virtual base* classes.
For each distinct base class that is specified virtual, 
the most derived object contains only one base class subobject of that type, 
even if the class appears many times in the inheritance hierarchy 
(as long as it is inherited virtual every time).
For example:

.. activecode:: ac_mult_inherit_ex2
   :language: cpp
   :compileargs: ['-Wall', '-Wextra', '-pedantic', '-std=c++11']

   #include<iostream> 
   #include<string> 
   using std::cout; 
   using std::string; 

   struct Person { 
       explicit
       Person(string n)  { cout << "Person(" << n << ") called\n";   } 
       Person()          { cout << "Person() called\n";   } 
   }; 
     
   struct Faculty : virtual public Person { 
       explicit
       Faculty(string n) : Person(n)   { 
          cout<<"Faculty(" << n << ") called\n"; 
       } 
   }; 
     
   struct Student : virtual public Person { 
       explicit
       Student(string n) : Person(n) { 
           cout<<"Student(" << n << ") called\n"; 
       } 
   }; 
     
   struct TeachingAssistant : public Faculty, public Student  { 
       explicit
       TeachingAssistant(string n)
         : Faculty(n), Student(n)   { 
           cout<<"TA(" << n << ") called\n"; 
       } 
   }; 
     
   int main()  { 
       TeachingAssistant ta("Alice"); 
   } 

This solves the 'multiple grandparent problem' for the teaching assistant class,
but note that the **default** Person constructor is called.
If the name is stored in the Person class,
then we need to call the non-default constructor.

The ``Person(string)`` constructor can be explicitly called in the
``TeachingAssistant`` initializer.
In order for ``Faculty`` and ``Student`` to initialize correctly,
the Person class must be constructed first:

.. code-block:: cpp

   explicit
       TeachingAssistant(string n)
         : Person(n), Faculty(n), Student(n)   { . . . } 

.. admonition:: Try This!

   Change the TA signature in the previous active code example
   to call the 1 argument Person constructor.

What about the situation where ``Person`` defines a virtual function,
which is overridden by ``Faculty`` and ``Student``?

Which version of the function is invoked?

There is no way to know.
Technically, any version could be called.
The standard doesn't specify anything in this situation
Most compilers will essentially bail and not call **any** of the functions.

The TA class can resolve the ambiguity by explicitly calling a specific
base class function.
The derived class must call the fully qualified name of the function
like this:

.. code-block:: cpp

   TeachingAssistant::foo() {
      if (weekday) {
         Faculty::foo();
      } else {
         Student::foo();
      }
   }

There is no obligation to always call all implementing functions,
but in practice, this is often needed.

Note that this defeats the entire purpose of having runtime polymorphism.
The derived class at the end of the inheritance chain might need
code containing 'knowledge' about **all** of its ancestor classes.
This is partly why the diamond is considered 'deadly'.

.. epigraph::

   **Do we really need multiple inheritance?**

   Not really. 
   We can do without multiple inheritance by using workarounds, 
   exactly as we can do without single inheritance by using workarounds. 
   We can even do without classes by using workarounds. 
   C is a proof of that contention. 
   However, every modern language with static type checking and inheritance 
   provides some form of multiple inheritance. 
   In C++, abstract classes often serve as interfaces and 
   a class can have many interfaces. 
   Other languages -- often deemed "not MI" -- 
   simply has a separate name for their equivalent to a pure abstract class: 
   an interface. 
   The reason languages provide inheritance (both single and multiple) 
   is that language-supported inheritance is typically superior to workarounds 
   (e.g. use of forwarding functions to sub-objects or separately allocated objects)
   for ease of programming, 
   for detecting logical problems, 
   for maintainability, and often for performance.

Design problems
---------------
New programmers are generally eager to "do things the OO way"
and tend to overuse inheritance relationships.
This is especially true if starting with UML diagrams:
many diagram look 'too simple' without a lot of boxes
connected by generalization and dependency relations.

Consider the following classes.

.. graphviz:: 
   :alt: Bird inheritance

   digraph "bird"
   {
     edge [fontname="BitstreamVeraSans",
           fontsize="10",
           labelfontname="BitstreamVeraSans",
           labelfontsize="10",
           dir="back",
           arrowtail="onormal",
           style="solid",
           color="midnightblue"];
     node [fontname="BitstreamVeraSans",
           fontsize="10",
           height=0.2,
           width=0.4,
           color="black",
           fillcolor="lightblue",
           shape=box,
           style="filled"];
     bird [shape=record,
       label="{bird\n|-wingspan: double|+fly(): void\l+eat(): void\l}"];
     bird -> hawk;
     bird -> owl;
     bird -> penguin;
     bird -> robin;
   }

.. reveal:: r_class_inherit
   :showtitle: Is this OK?

   No.

   We have asserted that a penguin can fly.

   We might choose to implement ``fly()`` in our penguin class
   and simply do nothing, 
   but generally when we do that we are coding our way around a
   basic design problem.

We will explore solutions for fixing these types of design problems 
in the next section.

.. admonition:: Guideline

   Prefer composition over inheritance.

It is very important when creating a class hierarchy using
inheritance that *every* derived class passes the **is a** test
for **all** of its bases.
For example:

.. code-block:: cpp

   struct oven: public kitchen { . . . };

This is not a proper relationship.
An oven is a thing commonly *found* in a kitchen,
but that does not mean an oven *is a* kitchen.
Because it fails this basic test,
it is likely that variables and functions that apply to the base:
``cupboards``, ``sink``, ``enter_room()``, etc
will fail to make sense when applied to the derived class.

This is an example better modelled through composition.
A kitchen **has a** sink in it.
