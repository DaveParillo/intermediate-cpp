Constructors
============

When we allocate storage for a built-in type,
we use the name of the type and a name for the variable:

.. code-block:: cpp

   int x;

As we saw in the previous section, the syntax for user-defined types is the same:

.. code-block:: cpp

   Talk say;


User-defined types use special functions to *construct* an object using the class definition.
We call these special functions *class constructors*.
Constructors are very similar to regular free functions, but there are a few special rules:

- A constructor is a **class member** function
- The function name is the **same name** as the class name
- A constructor has **no return type**

**All** classes must have at least 1 constructor.
If you do not write one, then compiler will try to create it automatically.
The Talk class worked because it used an automatically defined default constructor
generated by the compiler.
