Preface
=======

There are many books available if you want to learn to program in C++.
Many excellent books are not appropriate for new language learners.
Many books, excellent when written,
have not been updated for the language changes which have occurred
over the past 10 - 15 years.

Many textbooks claiming to be 'for C++' are not much more than
bare bones ports from other languages.
I take exception especially to this group, as they claim to be
C++ textbooks (and charge good money for it), however,
they do not teach good **idiomatic** C++.

What do I mean by **idiomatic** C++?

   `English As She Is Spoke <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_As_She_Is_Spoke>`_ 
   is the common name of a 19th-century book written by Pedro Carolino.

   As a well-meaning person, to be sure, his goal was to create a
   Portuguese-to-English phrase book.
   One minor obstacle stood in Pedro's way.
   He apparently spoke no English.

   Undaunted, and armed with both an earlier Portuguese-French phrase book
   and a French-English dictionary, he managed to create a book that is
   generally incomprehensible.

   He never intended to write a humor book, but that was the unintended result.
   Mark Twain is quoted as saying:[1]_

      Nobody can add to the absurdity of this book, 
      nobody can imitate it successfully, 
      nobody can hope to produce its fellow; 
      it is perfect.


While most 'C++' textbooks that have been marginally ported from other
languages cannot hope to achieve the level of silliness reached by
English As She Is Spoke, they still fail in the more fundamental sense.
That is, they fail to teach C++ as C++.
C++ is not C, Python, Java, Visual Basic, or anything else.

Moreover, the C++ of 1998 is not the C++ of today.

Good, idiomatic C++ embodies the philosophy behind the C++ Core Guidelines\ [2]_\ ,
the first few of which are:

- Ideas are expressed in code
- Code in ISO Standard C++
- Express intent

The goal of this book is not to describe every language feature in C++.
C++ is a large language.
If you really want to read about every language feature,
then best place to go is `cppreferemce.com <http://en.cppreference.com/w/>`_.
The goal of this book is to describe the current version of the language
in a clear, concise style, supplemented by meaningful activities
where appropriate.

Programming is not a "spectator sport".  It is something you do,
something you participate in. It would make sense, then,
that the book you use to learn programming should allow you to be active.

This book is meant to provide you with an interactive experience as you learn
to program.  You can read the text, watch videos,
and write and execute code.  In addition to simply executing code,
there are visualizations which allow you to control the
flow of execution, 
and watch variables as they are created and destroyed,
in order to gain a better understanding of how the program works.

Different presentation techniques are used where they are
most appropriate.  In other words, sometimes it might be best to read a
description of some aspect of a programming language.  On a different occasion,
is might be best to execute a small example program.  Often we provide multiple
options for covering the material.  Hopefully, you will find
your understanding is enhanced because you are able to experience
content in more than just one way.
