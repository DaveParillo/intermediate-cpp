Preface
=======

There are many books available if you want to learn to program in C++.  In
fact, we have written a few of them ourselves.  However,
none of the books are like this one.

Programming is not a "spectator sport".  It is something you do,
something you participate in. It would make sense, then,
that the book you use to learn programming should allow you to be active.
That is our goal.

This book is meant to provide you with an interactive experience as you learn
to program.  You can read the text, watch videos,
and write and execute code.  In addition to simply executing code,
there is a unique feature called 'codelens' that allows you to control the
flow of execution in order to gain a better understanding of how the program
works.

Different presentation techniques are used where they are
most appropriate.  In other words, sometimes it might be best to read a
description of some aspect of a programming language.  On a different occasion,
is might be best to execute a small example program.  Often we give you many
different options for covering the material.  Hopefully, you will find
your understanding is enhanced because you are able to experience
content in more than just one way.
