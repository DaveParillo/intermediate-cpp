   pair: FAQ; should I learn C first

Should I learn C first?
=======================

Maybe.

The answer depends partly on what kind of software projects might interest you (see :doc:`q110-what-language`).

You certainly do not need to learn C as a prerequisite for learning C++.
If you already know some C, it doesn't hurt, but there is no real advantage to learning C first.
C does many things 'the hard way' and many solutions to the same problems in the two languages end up being quite different.
