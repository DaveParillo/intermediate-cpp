   pair: FAQ; Do I need to know math

Do I need to know math?
=======================

*Math* is a broad topic.

Nearly every programming statement in any language
is either a *logic expression* or an *algebraic statement*.
A firm grasp of boolean expressions, basic (high school) algebra,
and an ability to think through problems is critical.
Programmers avoid this material at their peril.

Don't panic.
Do most programmers spend their days working through advanced calculus problems?
No.

The final answer ultimately depends on what kind of programs you write.
If you are writing game graphics or physics engines, 
numerical modeling, 
complex financial analysis, or something similar,
then yes, math is critical.

If you spend a lot of time in a specialized domain like these,
then you may find a physics degree as useful as a math or computer science degree.
Otherwise, a solid understanding of what you learned in high school
will suffice most of the time.

**One last word:**

In my experience, programmers who know more math,
or who have specialized domain expertise
are more highly compensated than those who don't
