   pair: FAQ; Do I need to know math

Do I need to know math?
=======================

*Math* is a broad topic.

For **most** programming activities, the answer is no (or very little).
Nearly every programming statement, however,
is either a *logic expression* or an *algebraic statement*.
So a firm grasp of boolean expressions, basic (high school) algebra,
and an ability to think through problems is critical.

The final answer also depends on what kind of programs you write.
If you are writing game graphics or physics engines, 
numerical modeling, 
complex financial analysis, or something similar,
then you may need to know some math.

If you spend a lot of time in a specialized domain like these,
then you may find a physics degree as useful as a math or computer science degree.

**One last word:**

In my experience, programmers who know more math,
or who have specialized domain expertise in some field
are more highly compensated than those who only know the basics.
