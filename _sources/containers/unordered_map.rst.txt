Hashing concepts
================

:doc:`Previously <associative-containers>`, 
we asserted that a :term:`map` refers to any data structure that 'maps' :term:`keys <key>` to values.
They have an advantage over sequential containers 
in that the cost of searches grows much more slowly: 
:math:`log_2 {N}` for maps versus :math:`N \over 2` for the sequential containers.

Is there a way to access elements in a tree that does not become more costly
as the number of elements grows?
We need to:

- Store data in some kind of *indexable data structure*:
  something we can access using an index, such as a ``vector``.
- Compute a value that will result in the index where are data is stored.

This is exactly what the unordered containers do.

The unordered containers all depend on :term:`hashing` to find elements.
:term:`Hashing <hashing>` is a search method that uses a 
:term:`hash function` to convert a :term:`key` into a position within a
:term:`hash table`. 

Often the :term:`backing storage` for an ``unordered_map`` is an array.
Each indexed location within the array is called a :term:`bucket`.
Each :term:`bucket` provides access to one or more map entries
(:term:`key-value pairs <key-value pair>`).

.. digraph:: hashtable
   :alt: Fruit inventory hash table

   graph [ 
     fontname = "Bitstream Vera Sans", 
     labelloc=b,
     label="Fruit inventory hash table"
     nodesep = .05;
     rankdir = LR;
   ];

   node[shape = record,  width = .1,  height = .1, 
        fontsize=14, style=filled, fillcolor=lightblue];
   edge [arrowhead=vee, arrowsize=0.5];

   node0[label = "<f0>0 | <f1>1 | <f2>2 | <f3>3 | <f4>4 | <f5>5 | <f6>6 ",  height = 2.5];

   node [width = 1.5];
   node1[label = "{<n> kiwi | 8 | <p>}"];
   node2[label = "{<n> pear | 5 | <p>}"];
   node3[label = "{<n> apple | 12 | <p>}"];
   node4[label = "{<n> lemon | 1 | <p>}"];
   node5[label = "{<n> grape | 13 | <p>}"];
   node6[label = "{<n> lime | 35 | <p>}"];
   node7[label = "{<n> banana | 3 | <p>}"];

   node0:f0->node1:n;
   node0:f1->node2:n;
   node0:f2->node3:n;
   node0:f5->node4:n;
   node0:f6->node5:n;
   node2:p->node6:n;
   node4:p->node7:n;


In order to use a type as a :term:`key` in an unordered container,
the type must override 3 functions:

- override :cref:`std::hash`
- override ``operator==``
- override ``operator<``

before the :term:`key` type will compile when added to an unordered container.

Consider the following :term:`hash table`:

.. digraph:: hashtable
   :alt: Simple hash table

   graph [ 
     fontname = "Bitstream Vera Sans", 
     labelloc=b,
     label="Simple hash table"
     nodesep = .05;
     rankdir = LR;
   ];

   node [fontname = "Bitstream Vera Sans", fontsize=14,
         style=filled, fillcolor=lightblue,
         width = .1,  height = .1
         shape=record];
   edge [arrowhead=vee, arrowsize=0.5];

   bucket[label = "<f0>0 | <f1>1 | <f2>2 | <f3>3 | <f4>4 | <f5>5 | <f6>6 \
                   | <f7>7 | <f8>8 | <f9>9 ",  height = 2.5];

   a [label="{ <data> 8 | <ref>  }"];
   b [label="{ <data> 3 | <ref>  }"];
   c [label="{ <data> 21 | <ref>  }"];
   d [label="{ <data> 55 | <ref>  }"];
   e [label="{ <data> 5 | <ref>  }"];
   f [label="{ <data> 34 | <ref>  }"];
   g [label="{ <data> 89 | <ref>  }"];
   h [label="{ <data> 13 | <ref>  }"];

   bucket:f1 -> a:data:w;
   bucket:f2 -> b:data;
   bucket:f4 -> c:data;
   bucket:f5 -> d:data;
   bucket:f8 -> e:data:w;
   e:ref:c -> f:data  [arrowtail=dot, dir=both, tailclip=false];
   f:ref:c -> g:data  [arrowtail=dot, dir=both, tailclip=false];
   b:ref:c -> h:data  [arrowtail=dot, dir=both, tailclip=false];

How does the software find the value ``34`` in this data structure?

The ``hash`` override is used to compute the bucket.
In this case the bucket is at index position ``8``.

Each element in the list stored in the bucket is evaluated using
``operator==``.
As soon as ``operator==`` evaluates to ``true`` the value is returned.

The ``operator<`` function is used when adding new elements to buckets.
New elements are kept sorted when added in order to reduce the time it takes to extract values from buckets.
It should be clear that the performance of this data structure is 
highly dependent upon the quality of the :term:`hash function`.
Always returning ``42`` is a *legitimate* value for a hash,
but an extremely poor one,
because your :term:`hash table` is no better than a :term:`linked list`.

All of the built in fundamental types and some other library types such as :cref:`std::string`
already have hash overrides defined.
If you define your own ``struct`` or ``class``, you need to write your own override.
Consider a ``struct Point``:

.. code-block:: cpp

   struct Point {
     int x;
     int y;
   }

   namespace std {   // must override std::hash
     template <>
     struct hash<Point>
     {
       std::size_t operator()(const Point& p) const
       {
         return ((std::hash<int>()(7919)
               ^ (std::hash<int>()(p.x) << 1)) >> 1)
               ^ (std::hash<int>()(p.y) << 1);
       }
     };
   }

The override must be a function template,
although in this case, no template parameter is needed.
The template declaration ``template <>`` is perfectly valid.

A :cref:`std::hash` override must be defined as a function object that takes the type as a parameter
and returns a :cref:`std::size_t`.
