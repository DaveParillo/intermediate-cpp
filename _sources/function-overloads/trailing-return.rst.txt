   pair: auto; trailing return type

Trailing return types
=====================

Problem:

- You created a template, but the return type needs to be a type other than one of the template parameters.

You'd like to be able to use auto to simply:

.. code-block:: cpp

   template<class T, class U>
   auto mystery_function(T t, U u);

Starting in C++17, this syntax works much more often than in previous version of the standard,
because the rules for deducing types have expanded.
Earlier version of C++, need to resort to a **trailing return type**

Even in C++17, depending on what a function does, return type deduction may not always work.
If it is possible for our function to return different types,
then a simple auto return will not compile:

.. code-block:: cpp

   auto f(bool val)
   {
       if (val) return 123; // deduces return type int
       else return 3.14f;   // error: deduces return type float
   }

You can use ``auto``, together with the ``decltype`` type specifier, 
to delay the evaluation of a function return value until after the function parameters have been declared.

Use ``auto`` and ``decltype`` to declare a function whose return type depends on the types of its arguments. 

To understand what's going on, first we have to understand ``decltype``.

Keyword: decltype
-----------------

Added in C++11,
the ``decltype`` type specifier yields the **type** of a specified expression, object, or literal value. 
We use decltype when we want to define a variable based on the result of an expression,
but we don't want to use the expression to initialize the variables value.
For example:

.. code-block:: cpp

   int i = 42;
   decltype(i) j = i * 2;

Similarly, there is a symmetry between auto and decltype:

.. code-block:: cpp

   auto a = 3u;       // a is unsigned;
   decltype(a) b = a; // same as auto b = a;  b is also unsigned


Trailing return type syntax
---------------------------

Since auto and decltype are complimentary operators,
they work well together to help write generic functions that avoid
committing to a specific type.

To declare a trailing return type for a function,
use this general form:

.. code-block:: cpp

   auto function_name () -> return_type
   {
     // function body
   }

The ``->`` is required to inform the compiler that a trailing return type follows.

Note that the return type is inserted after function parameters and
before the function body.



.. code-block:: cpp

   auto f(bool val) -> float
   {
       if (val) return 123; // deduces return type int
       else return 3.14f;   // error: deduces return type float
   }


.. code-block:: cpp

   template<typename T, typename U>
   auto add(T t, U u) -> decltype(t + u)
   {
       return t+u;
   }

Calling this add function like so:

.. code-block:: cpp

   auto val = numeric_limits<unsigned short>::max(); // typically 65,536
   auto sum = add(val, val);

Even though a variable of type ``unsigned short`` was used in both parameters,
the return type can't be unsigned short,
because the returned value is too large to fit.
If we had committed to a type, or used one of the generic types provided in the template,
our result would overflow.
Instead, the compiler used ``decltype`` to determine in this case, 
the return type should be ``int``.
