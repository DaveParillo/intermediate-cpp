Introducing Gnu/Linux
---------------------

Early in its evolution, 
the command-line environment of UNIX (its only user interface back then) 
became dominated by dozens of small utilities and tools which are still in common use today.
These tools are small and generally do one thing well. 
Most read from 'standard input' and write to 'standard output'.
The tools are commonly chained together in longer command pipelines, 
one program passing its output to the next as input, 
and controlled by a variety of command-line options and arguments.

This is one aspect of UNIX that makes it a powerful environment for processing 
text-based data, one of its first uses in a corporate environment. 
Dump some text in one end of a command pipeline and retrieve processed output from the other end.
As programmers, this is useful, because at its core, programming involves manipulating text:
transforming source code into executable machine code, 
converting database query results into readable reports, etc.

This section is not intended to make you an expert if you have never
used linux before.
It is intended to give you enough of a jump start to demystify things somewhat
and ease forward progress.

Getting access
..............

All projects and some of the lab assignments are required to be handed in on the
San Diego Mesa College server **buffy**.
Access is only available using a *secure shell* client program (ssh).
There are a few ways to access buffy using ``ssh``.
If you have a MacOS X or Linux computer available already, then you already have ssh installed.
If you have a Windows computer, 
then my first recommendation is to install ``git``.
Technically, ``git`` is a source code revision control program,
but it also provides a minimal GNU/Linux environment 
(not too surprising since the creator, Linus Torvalds, is also the creator of Linux).
Git provides just about everything you need, except for a compiler.

Another good choice for an SSH
client if you run Microsoft Windows is PuTTY:

.. code-block:: none

   http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/

In ``git`` you would type the following in the *GIT Bash* to connect to the buffy server:

.. code-block:: none

   host@user: ssh fireNN@209.129.16.61

where *fireNN** is the user name assigned to you by the instructor.


The command line
................

A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system.
You enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback is returned as text.

The command line typically presents you with a prompt. 
As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt.
Most of the time you will be issuing commands. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: none

   host@user: ls -l /home/user
   total 12
   -rw-rw---- 1 user student  419 May 29 06:49 main.cpp
   -rw-rw---- 1 user student 3320 May 29 06:50 util.h
   -rw-r--r-- 1 user student  725 May 29 06:49 vim_tips.md
   host@user:

What's happening?

* The first line is the **prompt** ( host\@user ). 
  On this first line, a command was also entered ``ls``.
  The ``ls`` command lists the contents of a directory.
  In this example, we also supplied some command line arguments (-l /home/user).
  It is conventional to start command line arguments (or 'switches') with a dash.
* The next 4 lines are output from the 'ls' command.
  Most commands produce output that is written to standard output,
  which in the case of running on the command line is the terminal itself.
* The last line displays the command prompt again.
  At this point, the system is waiting for the next command.

  If no prompt is displayed, this means the command is still running.

Absolute vs relative paths
..........................

Look at the argument passed to the ``ls`` command in the previous example:

.. code-block:: none

   /home/user

Specifically, this indicates the *absolute path* to the directory ``/home/user``.
There are 2 types of paths we can use, **absolute** and **relative**. 
All references to a file or directory use one of these forms. 

Absolute path 
    Specifies a location starting at the **root directory**. 
    An absolute path *must* start with the character '/'.

Relative path 
    Specifies a location in relation the current working directory. 
    A relative path will *never* start with the character '/'.

When navigating or specifying paths, there are two special files which
reside in every directory: ``.`` and ``..``.

\.
  The single dot ``.`` file contains information about the files in the current
  directory.  In many commands, it is synonymous with the current directory.

\..
  The two dots ``..`` file contains information about the files in the directory
  that is the parent of the current directory.
  The only directory that does not contain a ``..`` file is the root directory: ``/``.


In addition, the character ~ (tilde) is an abbreviation for the path to any user home directory.

.. code-block:: none

   ls ~alice/public_html

Displays the contents of the public_html folder in her home directory,
regardless of where her home directory actually is located.


.. reveal:: reveal-skill-check-paths

   .. mchoice:: mc_paths_1
      :multiple_answers:
      :correct: a,c,e
      :answer_a: ../usr/bin
      :answer_b: /usr/bin
      :answer_c: ./
      :answer_d: /
      :answer_e: user/files
      :feedback_a: Correct. ../usr/bin does not start with a '/'.
      :feedback_b: /usr/bin starts with a slash.
      :feedback_c: Correct. ./ does not start with a '/'.
      :feedback_d: / this is the 'root' directory.
      :feedback_e: Correct. user/files does not start with a '/'.

      Which of the following statements are **relative paths**?  Check all that apply.

   .. mchoice:: mc_paths_2
      :multiple_answers:
      :correct: a,b,d
      :answer_a: In directory <tt>/tmp</tt>, <tt>../home/user</tt>

      :answer_c: In directory <tt>/home/user</tt>, <tt>..</tt> 
      :answer_d: In directory <tt>/home/user/work</tt>, <tt>..</tt> 
      :answer_e: In directory <tt>/home/user/work</tt>, <tt>../../user</tt> 
      :feedback_a: Correct. 
      :feedback_b: Correct. 
      :feedback_c: This lists the contents of <tt>/home</tt>.
      :feedback_d: Correct. 
      :feedback_e: This attempts to list the contents is <tt>/user</tt>.

      Which of the following paths list the contents ``/home/user``?  Check all that apply.

Basic commands
..............

pwd
   Prints the working directory name.
   ``pwd`` prints the full path name of the directory you are currently in.

ls
   Print directory contents.
   With no arguments, :code:`ls` prints the current directory contents,
   that is the contents of the directory returned by :code:`pwd`.
   For each operand that names a file
   of type directory, ls displays the names of files contained within that directory, as
   well as any requested, associated information.

   The :code:`ls` command has a **lot** of options.

cd
   Change directory.
   With no arguments, (just ``cd``), this command will take you to **your**
   home directory.
   A file after the cd command ``cd ../lab/solutions`` changes the current working
   directory to the named path.

   The special name ``~`` is a shortcut for the users home directory.

mkdir
   Make a new directory. At least one argument is required. For example:

   .. code-block:: bash

      host@user: cd
      host@user: ls -l 
      total 4
      -rw-rw---- 1 user student  419 May 29 06:49 main.cpp
      host@user: mkdir labs
      host@user: ls -l 
      total 8
      drwx------ 1 user student  419 May 29 15:06 labs
      -rw-rw---- 1 user student  419 May 29 06:49 main.cpp

man
   Display manual pages for a command.

   There is an **enormous** amount of information available from the command line.
   Conceived of and written before the internet existed, it was intended
   to function as a comprehensive reference for everything a programmer
   would need to know to be productive in Unix.  For example:

   .. code-block:: man

      host@user: man ascii
   
      ASCII(7)               Linux Programmer's Manual              ASCII(7)
      NAME
         ascii - ASCII character set encoded in octal, decimal, and hexadecimal

      DESCRIPTION
         ASCII  is  the American Standard Code for Information Interchange.  
         It is a 7-bit code.  Many 8-bit codes (such as ISO 8859-1, the Linux 
         default character  set)  contain  ASCII  as  their lower half.  
         The international counterpart of ASCII is known as ISO 646.

         The following table contains the 128 ASCII characters.

         C program '\X' escapes are noted.
